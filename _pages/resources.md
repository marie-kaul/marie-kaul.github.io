### Website

[This](https://academicpages.github.io/) is the template I used to make this website. It's really very easy!

### Coding

[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) is a great (free) resource for programming, especially for beginners. They have core lessons on the Unix Shell, R, Python, Git (and more).
